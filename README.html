<h1>Gcode Completion Time Estimation Challenge</h1>
<p>In this challenge, you will estimate the time it takes for a simulated 3D printer to complete a given set of machine instructions.</p>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code">Gcode</a> is machine code that is often used to control automated manufacturing tooling, such as 3D printers. Each line of gcode describes a single action, which will take a finite period of time to execute (often over a second). A single gcode file may have millions of commands, so it can take a long time to complete (often hours). For planning purposes, we often want to accurately estimate how long a gcode file will take to execute on a real machine, without actually executing it. This is nontrivial because the machine itself applies control and decides how to move. For example, it may decelerate near sharp corners to avoid overshooting. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to algorithmically estimate the time-to-completion of a given gcode file.</p>
<p>We have created a virtual 3D printer simulator to provide ground-truth time-to-completion statistics for arbitrary gcode. You can use our API to develop and test your solution. Information about this API, as well as our simplified gcode specification are provided below in the appendix.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>We have provided a few Python scripts to demonstrate different interactions with our API. They are intended to be a reference. Feel free to take it or leave it; use whatever tools you see prefer!</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Make sure you have Python installed on your system, along with the ‘requests’ module.</p>
<pre><code>$ pip install requests
</code></pre>
<p>You should also add your candidate identifier to an environment variable to avoid having to include it with every command line invocation (see <a href="http://common.py">common.py</a>);</p>
<pre><code>$ export CANDIDATE_ID=[your candidate ID]
</code></pre>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<pre><code># ping our server, should return 'pong' if everything is working correctly
$ python ping.py

# Execute inline-specified gcode, should return a json object with execution_time and lines_received
$ python execute.py 'G00 X10' 'G00 Y10'

# Execute gcode from a file, should return a json object with execution_time and lines_received
$ python execute_file.py test_cases/test_small.gcode

# Request a small test case, should return a json object with test_case_id and url
$ python request_test_case.py small

# Post a time-estimate of 10 seconds for test case with ID cd456d14-4989-4134-8174-b9c75232be65
$ python post_estimate.py 10.0 cd456d14-4989-4134-8174-b9c75232be65
</code></pre>
<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h3>Is there a time limit?</h3>
<p>No, there’s no strict time limit. That said, your time is valuable, and we don’t want to waste it! We anticipate this should take roughly an hour to complete a decent solution. Feel free to spend some time interacting with our API to better characterize execution time and improve your model, but you don’t need to spend all day on this.</p>
<h3>How good should my solution be?</h3>
<p>That’s up to you. Perfect solutions are possible, but not required. One naive solution which can easily be implemented in under an hour gives on average under 5% error on large test cases. However, this solution has high variance on small test cases, often returning estimates with over 25% error.</p>
<h3>What if I have an issue with the API?</h3>
<p>Please let us know so we can investigate.</p>
<h3>I’m done, now what?</h3>
<p>Please send us your code for review.</p>
<h3>How is my solution evaluated?</h3>
<p>Once you complete our challenge, we will review both our server logs and your source code. We will mostly ignore any test case estimate posts where response[“timeout”] or response[“already_completed”] are true. We will primarily review several of your most recent successful posts to evaluate the performance of your algorithm, so once you perfect your code, you should run it a few times on small, medium, and large test cases!</p>
<h1>Appendix</h1>
<h2>Gcode Definition</h2>
<p>For this challenge, we will consider a simplified subset of gcode. Specifically, there will be one command, the “rapid positioning” command G00. Since 3D printers typically have 3 axes of head motion, plus an extruder, we will consider four axes X, Y, Z, and E. All axes are provided absolute positions (not relative to current position).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>X:</strong> The X-axis of the print head (in mm). Controls side-to-side positioning of the print head if you face the printer.</li>
<li><strong>Y:</strong> The Y-axis of the print head (in mm). Controls front-to-back positioning of the print head if you face the printer.</li>
<li><strong>Z:</strong> The Z-axis of the print bed (in mm). This controls the up-down positioning of the print bed relative to the print head.</li>
<li><strong>E:</strong> The “extrusion axis”. This is the total amount of material extruded by the print head (in mm). If command E to position 10 from position 0, 10mm of filament is extruded. Keep in mind that this is an <em>absolute</em> coordinate space, so commanding E to position 10 while already at position 10 would extrude no filament.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>As is typical of gcode, each axis is optional. Omitted axes are supposed to simply stay where they are. For example, if you command “G00 Z10” you want the print bed to move, but the print head and extuder should remain stationary.</li>
<li>At the beginning of each file, the printer starts at state (X=0, Y=0, Z=0, E=0)</li>
<li>The max state is: (X=100, Y=100, Z=100, E=1,000,000)</li>
<li>The min state is: (X=-100, Y=-100, Z=-100, E=0)</li>
<li>Any inputs outside of these bounds will be clipped to the bounds</li>
<li>Each line begins with the string “G00” followed axis names and desired positions</li>
<li>The value for each axis comes immediately after the axis name, with no space, and may be either a float or integer value (“X1” is equvalent to “X1.0”)</li>
<li>Comments are indicated with the “#” character. Anything after a “#” will be ignored</li>
<li>The axes are always provided in the order X, Y, Z, E. Providing out-of-order axes leads to undefined behavior.</li>
<li>Each axis is expected to linearly vary with respect to other axes over the movement (but not necessarily with respect to time). In other words, if from (X=0, Y=0, Z=0, E=0) you command “G00 X10 E20”, when the extruder is at position (X=5) it should also be at position (E=10).</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code>G00 X10.0 Y10 # Move to position X=10, Y=10. Z=0, E=0 implied by omission.
G00 Z5.0 # Move to position Z=5. X=10, Y=10, E=0 implied by omission.
G00 E10 # Extrude 10mm of filament. X=10, Y=10, Z=5 implied by omission.
